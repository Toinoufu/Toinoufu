### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Toinoufu and I am currently a student in computer science and this is my personal github account
where I will show some of my personnal work that isn't related to my school.

 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python in college and c++ and java by myself !
 - âš¡ Fun fact: I am really shy
